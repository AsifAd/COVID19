    <h4>
        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by
        taking some simple precautions
    </h4>
    <div class="h5 list">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based
                hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your
                hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
                viruses that may be on your hands.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray
                small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain
                virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,
                including the COVID-19 virus if the person has the disease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people come together
                in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with
                someone that has COIVD-19 and it is more difficult to maintain
                physical distance of 1 metre (3 feet).
            </li>
            <li>
                Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many
                surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can
                transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
                virus can enter your body and infect you.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your hands. Why?
                Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene,
                you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu
                and COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as
                cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone
                bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask
                to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with others
                will protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
                medical attention, but call by telephone in advance if possible
                and follow the directions of your local health authority. Why?
                National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance
                will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to
                the right health facility. This will also protect you and help
                prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

            Advice on the safe use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers
        </span>
    </h2>
    <h4>
        To protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands
        frequently and thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash your
        hands with soap and water. If you use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer,
        make sure you use and store it carefully.
    </h4>
    <div class="h5 list">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Keep alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of childrenâ€™s reach.
                Teach them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apply a coin-sized amount on your hands. There is no need to use
                a large amount of the product. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth
                and nose immediately after using an alcohol-based hand
                sanitizer, as it can cause irritation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hand sanitizers recommended to protect against COVID-19 are
                alcohol-based and therefore can be flammable. Do not use before
                handling fire or cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Under no circumstance, drink or let children swallow an
                alcohol-based hand sanitizer. It can be poisonous.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember that washing your hands with soap and water is also
                effective against COVID-19.
